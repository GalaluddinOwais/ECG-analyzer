# About the project
####
This project aims to analyze an ECG signal provided in .mat format. It detects and marks the peaks (the R peaks in the QRS complex) to calculate the heart rate. Additionally, it checks for the presence of Bigeminy and Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) diseases, and displays the level of confidence with the provided results

# Key Achievements
* Designed a GUI to get the ECG signals uploaded and visualize them
* Provided calculation of the heart rate after visualizing peaks spotted
* Provided detection of two specific diseases (Bigeminy and Premature Ventricular Contraction)

# Requirements
#### Any `MATLAB` version should work!

# Execution
#### locate `load_ECG.m` and `load_ECG.fig` and run the following commands:
```
#execute MATLAB
matlab

#run the application
run('load_ECG.m')
```
